# Request Header Parser Microservice

This project is a very simple Header Parser Microservice that parses the headers requested from the client, built using the Express framework. Once the request is complete, the API responds with a JSON object containing the user's IP address, language, and software. 

## Key Features:

- API Endpoint: GET /api/:whoami? : parses a ==:whoami== object which is then used to request ==headers== from the client.
